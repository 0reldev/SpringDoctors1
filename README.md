# Quest "Spring 01: Start"

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

This quest teaches how to initialize a project with Spring Initializr (Maven, POM file, project structuration). 

The aim is to create routes to display the name of a specific Doctor Who depending on his number. It introduces the use of a <code>Controller</code> with the
use of <code>@GetMapping</code> and <code>@ResponseBody</code> annotations.
